<p> Composers write and direct original music used to produce various types of media entertainment and they also create and arrange musical scores for anything that requires a soundtrack. The scores written need to be technically correct in order to create flawless performances by choruses, musicians or instrumental ensembles. Sound recordings produced from the score vary in style and may reflect the classical, country, folk, jazz, techno, or pop genres. </p>
