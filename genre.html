	<ul><p>The musical genres in traditional Malay music include asli (‘original’, ‘traditional’), ronggeng, inang and joget (music which typically accompanying social dances), dondang sayang (songs of affection), keroncong (a type of folk music), zapin (music accompanying the zapin dance) and ghazal (typically tied to themes of romance sung in poetic quatrains). </p></ul>

	<ul><p>Practitioners have shared that characteristics of traditional Malay music from these various genres include the use of grenek-grenek, which are trill signatures in compositions, and the use of cengkok which is the use of extended melismatic notes (singing a single syllable text and carrying it through multiple notes). The lyrics of traditional Malay music are usually set in Malay poetic forms – namely, the pantun, gurindam and syair, which lends a distinct Malay form of cultural expression. </p></ul>

	<ul><p> In the 1960s, Western pop music was particularly influential on local music scenes in Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei. When Cliff Richard and the Shadows played in Singapore in 1961, he inspired many copycat acts,[7] and public viewing of the Cliff Richard's films in the region were often augmented with local cover bands emulating their songs.[8] One particular genre influenced by Western guitar-band called 'Pop Yeh-yeh' came to the forefront and ruled the Malay music scene from 1965 to 1971. This genre was influenced by the music and fashion of The Beatles and other British rock and roll bands during the 1960s that also generally influenced the Malay music industry of that period. In fact, the term "pop yeh-yeh" was taken from a line from the popular Beatles song, "She Loves You" ("she loves you, yeah-yeah-yeah").[9] Southern European yé-yé music has the same etymology. The term "pop yeh yeh" however was never used in the 1960s but used much later when such music was revived in the 1980s by M. Shariff & The Zurah. It might be that music journalists of the 1980s coined the term.</p></ul>

	<ul><p>The first local song in the Pop Yeh-yeh vein was a song called "Suzanna", sung by M Osman in 1964. During the height of the pop yeh-yeh craze, a lot of the bands that were formed tried their best to mimic The Beatles in their look, songwriting and performance style, yet the musical style was still taken from The Shadows and The Ventures. These bands, known as kirtans, consists usually of four members who sing on top of handling the basic four musical instruments (two electric guitars, an electric bass, and drums). Most of the bands were formed in both Singapore and Malaysia, with the southern state of Johore and Singapore was the hub of activity for these particular bands. Most of the recordings were done in Singapore such as at the old EMI Studio at MacDonald's House in Orchard Road and many small privately owned studios. </p></ul>

	<ul><p>Middle 1990s To late 2000s
	The mid 1990 and onwards, plenty of punk rock music have emerged. Music showcase and events were held frequently. Though most Malaysian rock bands have a tendency to sing in English, lately more bands have begun singing in their native language, Bahasa Malaysia. Contemporary bands such as Awie, OAG, Butterfingers, MARIONEXXES, Estranged, Pop Shuvit, Bunkface, and Paku have all become popular not only in Malaysia, but also in Indonesia (since Indonesian rock bands and their sound of music had previously greatly influenced the Malaysian market), Singapore, and Japan, due to their frequent collaboration with internationally renowned artists. Pop Shuvit in particular had achieved tremendous success in Japan with three successful headlining tours as well as a Top 20 album sales charting at Tower Records. </p></ul>
